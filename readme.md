Power meter
-----------


  Small arduino set up for gathering statistics on power usage with a light-dependent resistor (LDR).

  There is a box on my main fusebox which flashes when a watt-hour has been consumed. I had the idea of hooking up an arduino -based LDR detector board in front of the flashy box and transmitting the flash count for record keeping.

  Work in progress

- Count pulses
- Transmit data using a 433MHz transmitter
